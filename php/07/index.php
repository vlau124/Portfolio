<p>
Process HTML form with a multiple selection list and genereates a verse of Old MacDonald for each animal the user selects.
</p>

<p>
For Example: <br>
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!<br>
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O!<br>
With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there<br>
<br>
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo-moo<br>
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!<br>
</p>

<p>
Your solution should include a function called printOneVerse, which will print one verse of the song. printOneVerse should take two arguments â€“ the name of an animal name and the sound that animal makes.
